# Discord AI Bot

This Discord bot is a discord bot that uses the Replicate api to generate ai images. It includes a daily limit of users and various things that allow you to add premium features. If you have any questions or special commands you want to ask or have done, you can contact @vxdb on discord :)

## Installation
For the bot to work you need to install the packages and create an .env file and add your bot's token and your MongoDB connection. The .env file should be as follows:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=""
MONGO="mongodb+srv://"
REPLICATE_TOKEN="TOKEN GO BRRR"
```
Don't forget to get your token via [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) ;)

Thanks to [Tolgchu](https://github.com/Tolga1452) for the discord.js template for this bot
